    * `price_summary`: Returns, price levels, and volatility.
    * `technical_metrics`: MA, RSI, MACD, and anomalies.
    * `fundamental_metrics`: Financial ratios (Profitability, Liquidity, Solvency).

## 2. Report Structure & Prompt Logic

### Output Format Rule (Apply to ALL sections)
For every indicator or metric, the LLM **must** output in the following format:
{Indicator Name}: {Actual Value or Range} → {2–3 sentence analytical interpretation explaining what this number means, why it matters for this specific company, and what signal it gives for investment decision-making.} 
**The LLM must never output numbers or values alone without interpretation.**
Every data point must be followed by a substantive analytical paragraph.
Default output language: **English**.

## 4. Copilot Execution Prompt

> "Implement the AI Analysis logic in `modules/analyzer.py` based on `#file:module4.md`.
> Construct a comprehensive prompt template that pipes Module 2 data and Module 3 insights into the LLM.
> The output must strictly follow the Executive Summary → Macro → Financial Health → Valuation → Comparison structure.
> For every single metric and indicator across all sections, the LLM must output:
> `{Indicator}: {Value} → {2–3 sentence analytical interpretation}`
> The LLM must never return standalone numbers without interpretation.
> Ensure the DCF calculation and Peer Comparison logic are dynamically handled based on the input tickers.
> Target Output: A structured Markdown report for the Streamlit 'AI Insight' tab."
